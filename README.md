Game Engine Lab 4 Exercise 2
I added an audi clip to my player in the move script and set it so that if the player hits the block, it plays the sound in the collision function.
I created a text ui and created a float for my health. If the player hits the block, in the collision function the health reduces by 1 and the update function will change the ui.
